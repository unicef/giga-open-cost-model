    "# Sceario Based Model Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "This dashboard enables scenario based, end-to-end model validation streamlined for the end user.\n",
    "In this case, model validation means a fully integrated, end-to-end model execution and comparison against expected results.\n",
    "These comparison are based on well defined scenarios described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validation Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenarios used for validation can be broken down into two groups: zero cost scenarios, constraint scenarios, and cost comparison scenarios.\n",
    "Both are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Zero Cost Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "The zero cost validation scenarios aim to validate that configuring cost driver parameters to zero will lead to zero costs in the output estimates of the models.\n",
    "Each of the zero cost scenarios is described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zero cost per kwh**: validates that setting electricity costs to zero leads to zero electricity OpEx costs for a school.\n",
    "    > **Decription:** \\\n",
    "    > **WHEN** the cost per kwh is set to zero for any technology,\\\n",
    "    > **THEN** the electricity opex costs should be zero in the model outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Zero cost internet mbps**: validates that setting mbps cost to zero leads to zero OpEx costs attributed to connectivity for a school.\n",
    "    > **Decription:** \\\n",
    "    > **WHEN** the mpbs cost is set to zero for any technology,\\\n",
    "    > **THEN** the technology opex costs should be composed of only the maintenance costs in the output.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Zero Technology OpEx**: validates that setting maintenance cost and mbps cost to zero leads to zero OpEx costs attributed to technology for a school.\n",
    "    > **Decription:** \\\n",
    "    > **WHEN** the maintenance cost is set to zero for any technology,\\\n",
    "    > **AND** the mpbs cost is set to zero for any technology,\\\n",
    "    > **THEN** the technology opex costs should be zero in the output.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Zero Intallation Cost**: validates that setting installation cost to zero leads to zero CapEx costs attributed to technology installation for a school.\n",
    "    > **Decription:** \\\n",
    "    > **WHEN** the intallation cost is set to zero for any technology,\\\n",
    "    > **THEN** the technology capex cost should be composed of only the capex attributed to the service provider.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **Zero Electricity CapEx**: validates that setting solar panel install costs to zero leads to no electricity CapEx costs attributed to a school\n",
    "    > **Decription:** \\\n",
    "    > **WHEN** the solar panel install cost is set to zero for any technology,\\\n",
    "    > **THEN** the electricity capex is zero.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 2. Technology Constraint Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "These scenarios validate technology constraints relevant to each respective model.\n",
    "The validation scenarios aim to set the constraint to an extreme to drive the models to a simplified outcome.\n",
    "Usually, this involved setting the constraint in a way that makes the technology an infeasible connectivity candidate.\n",
    "Each constraint scenario is described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fiber: zero maximum connection length**: validates that setting the maximum connection length to zero leads to no schools being connected with fiber technology.\n",
    "    > **Decription:** \\\n",
    "    > **WHEN** modeling fiber technology only,\\\n",
    "    > **AND** the maximum connection length is set to zero,\\\n",
    "    > **THEN** no schools schould be connected using fiber.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cellular: zero maximum range**: validates that setting the maximum range leads to no schools being connected with cellular technology.\n",
    "    > **Decription:** \\\n",
    "    > **WHEN** modeling cellular technology only,\\\n",
    "    > **AND** the maximum range is set to zero,\\\n",
    "    > **THEN** no schools schould be connected using cellular.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **P2P: zero maximum range**: validates that setting the maximum range leads to no schools being connected with P2P technology.\n",
    "    > **Decription:** \\\n",
    "    > **WHEN** modeling P2P technology only,\\\n",
    "    > **AND** the maximum range is set to zero,\\\n",
    "    > **THEN** no schools schould be connected using P2P.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Demand: exceeds max bandwidth**: validates that setting the bandwidth demand above the bandwidth capacity for a given technology leads to no schools being connected with that technology.\n",
    "    > **Decription:** \\\n",
    "    > **WHEN** the bandwidth demand exceeds the bandwidth capacity for any technology,\\\n",
    "    > **THEN** no schools schould be connected using that technology.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3. Single School Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "These scenarios validate non-zero cost drivers on a single school.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Electricity: cost per kwh**: validates that the electricity opex is determined by the power requirement of a technology and the cost per kwh.\n",

    "    > **THEN** the annual opex electricity cost at the school should be the product of the two values above of `120` USD,\\\n",

    "    \n",
    "2. **Connectivity: cost of mbps**: validates that the connectivity opex is determined by the bandwidth demand and the cost of mbps.\n",
